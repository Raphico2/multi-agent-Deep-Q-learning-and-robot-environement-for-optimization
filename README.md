# multi-agent-Deep-Q-learning-and-robot-environement-for-optimization
The code refer to the full integration of a restaurant environment, managed by robots using multi-agent deep Q learning model 

Our project deals with robot cognition and collaboration in order to perform optmization task. The goal was to create a restaurant environment and train robots to manage and optmize the gestion of the restaurant. The restaurant is a Pizza fast food where customers enter, order, wait until be served and then pay and eat. The robots are divided into two type, waiter robots and cooker robots. They must learn how to cooperate to answer the demand as fast as possible, keep the restaurant clean and then improve the customer satsfaction in order to increase the income. The report aims to detail the environment, the robots, the AI model we used and our results.
